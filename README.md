We follow the greedy approach and compare the new Profit each time if it is maximum than the previous profit we update it ,
thereby finding an optimal solution of the problem.
Brute force approach for the same problem would be to use nested loop and find profit for every element when bought
and sold which takes O(n^2) however the greedy approach takes O(n) time complexity.
